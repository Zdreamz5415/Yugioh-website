<br>
<p>Vinilla summoning is very basic if your monster is a vinilla monster it has no special abilitys and is the most under used monsters in yugioh for how weak they are.</p>
<img id="image2" src="images/vinillamonster1.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Effect summoning is like vinilla summoning for the exception of effect monsters have abiltys while vinilla dose not.</p>
<img id="image3" src="images/effectmonster1.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Tribute summoning if a effect/vinilla monster has a level of 5-6 you only require 1 card as tribute which you would send to the graveyard but if the level of the monster is 7-12 you would have to make 2 cards go to the graveyard</p>
<img id="image4"src="images/tributemonster1.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Special summoning can only be done using ethier spells,traps or using an effect monster its like summoning a normal monster except you can summon another monster on the same turn </p>
<br>
<p>Fusion summoning First: You will need to have the required monsters on the card and a polymarazation in your hand. Secondly: You will have to use polymarazation to fusion summon the monster that you want.</p>
<img id="image5" src="images/fusionmonster1.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Ritual summoning can only be done using a spell card and also by having all the required monsters in your hand so first. You will need to have the spell card for the ritual summon to commence. Second: You will need the required monsters on the card to proform the ritual summon. Thirdly: you will need to have the ritual monster in your hand to proform the summon.</p>
<p>You see a ritual monster dose not go into your extra deck it goes into your main deck so a lot of people will use cards to try and get their cards out quicker by using spells and traps.</p>
<img id="image6" src="images/ritualmonsters.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Syncro summoning: First you will need the cards required on the card to syncro which ussually involves 1 tuner monster and 1 non tuner monster. Second: You will need them to all have the same level as your syncro monster then you will be able to syncro summon.</p>
<p>However you can use more then 1 non tuner monster to syncro summon</p>
<img id="image7" src="images/syncromonster.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Xyz summoning: First: You will need 2 or more monsters with the same level as your XYZ monster. Second: You then overlay all the monsters required which is between 2/3 monsters and XYZ summon your monster.</p>
<p>Fun little fact the monster levels on an XYZ monster are known as ranks and not levels.</p>
<img id="image8" src="images/xyzmonster.png" alt="monster">
<br>
<p>Pendulum summoning 1 First: You need to know about pendulum zones their are 2 on each side of the field if you put a pendulum monster with a rank of 1 and another on the other side with the rank of 12 you can summon monsters form level 2/11 without having to tribute summon. secondly: pendulum cards have 2 effects 1 is a spell effect and 2 is a normal effect if the monster is in the pendulum zone it then becomes a spell card if a pendulum card is normal summoned it then can use its normal effect. </p>
<p>With pendulum summoning you need to be very expirianced to summon it and use them correctly also not all pendulums have a normal effect you can have something called a vinilla pendulum which has no normal effect but still has a spell effect.</p>
<p>Pendulums can also be a syncro monster, fusion monster, Xyz monster and also a ritual monster also when any pendulums are destroyed they don't get sent to the graveyard they go back to your extra deck. </p>

<p>You have now learned all the summoning techniques in duel links so go out and have fun dueling.</p>
<br>
<q>Its not how you use the card its how you decide to play it.</q>
