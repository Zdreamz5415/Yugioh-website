<p class="center">Now were going to talk about what all of these spells actually do and how to use them??</p>

<p class="center">What is a normal spell?
    well a normal spell is a spell card that can only be used in your turn using normal spell cards usually 
    give you more attack and defence power or usually allow you to special summon monsters to your field.
    sometimes they also allow you to summon powerful monsters such as using polymarazation to fusion summon. 
</p>

<p class="center">what is a field spell?
    Well a field spell usually changes the battlefield they are also like normal spells on the fact of you can only use them on 
    your turn. Each field has a diffrent effect some increase attack and defence such as Yami and others take life points away for you to summon monsters.
</p>

<p class="center">what is a equip spell?
    Well an equip spell can only be equiped to a monster card that is in face up attack or face up defence mode each and every equip spell is diffrent
    some will gain you life points others will gain you attack some will even damage you but equip spells are very handy and can get you out of a jam.
</p>

<p class="center">How do i use a Continuous spell??
    A continuous spell can be used in your turn again but unlike the other spells we have discused from the eception of an equip spell.
    Once a continous spell is activated it will stay on the field untill ethier its own effect destroys it or your opponent wipes it out 
    unlike equip spells though the only way for a continuous spell to be destroyed is by effect,spell or trap crads being used to destroy it.
</p>

<p class="center">How do i use a quick play spell?
    Quick play spells in my opinion are the best cards in yugioh mainly because you can use a quick play spell in your opponents turn.
    When you use a quick play spell in your opponents it usualy stops their attack or destroys something on their field. 
    There are downsides to using quick play spells as well tho ussually your opponents are not that stupid so they will run cards that counter act your spells.
</p>

<p class="center">How do i use a ritual spell?
    I have disscused these spells in a small amount of detail before in the summoning guide but if you want a more in depth version here you are.
    Ritual spells are spell cards that can summon high level monsters from your hand these monsters are know as ritual monsters. Anyways ritual cards
    are kind of complicated to use the best way to put it is until you have a ritual monster in your hand you can not use this spell on the card their will be a list
    of monsters and usually you have to have them monsters in your hand to ritual summon if you are still confused i don't blame you the best way to learn to ritual summon is by watching someone else.
</p>

<p class="center">Were now going to learn about trap cards and what they do?</p>

<p class="center"> What is a normal trap?
    A normal trap can be activated once your opponent has ethier attacked you, used an effect or has tried to use another trap or spell card against you.
    out of all the trap cards this is by far the easiest one to learn how to do.
</p>

<p class="center">what is a continuous trap?
    A continous trap has only one small diffrence to a continuous spell a trap can only be activated in your opponents turn unless you wait another turn to activate it on your turn instead.  
</p>

<p class="center">What is a counter trap?
    This is probably one of the best traps you can use usually a counter trap would destroy your opponents monster or could inflict damage.
    It can also destroy your opponents spells and traps depending on what the effect on the card is.
</p>

<p class="center"> This is all the infomation your going to need to know about spells and traps i hope this helped any questions you have about trap and spell cards </p>
